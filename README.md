<h2>Identifying Fraud from Enron Emails and Financial Data</h2>
<p>
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record,	including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives.

In this project, I used machine learning to identify persons of interest (POI) based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. The POI is labeled list of individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.
